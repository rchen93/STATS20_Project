NOTE: The archives should contain two versions of this dataset.

USNEWS.DAT contains the data in a comma delimited format with a
single row of data for each college.

USNEWS3.DAT contains the data in a fixed column format with three
data lines for each school and a maximum line length of 80
characters.

The format for USNEWS3.DAT is described below, although the same
variables in the order given below are found on each row of
USNEWS.DAT.

STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
This dataset is used along with another (see aaup.txt) as the 
basis for the 1995 Data Analysis Exposition.  This is a special 
session at the Joint Statistical Meetings in which uses a
common dataset as a vehicle for demonstrating innovative
approaches to analyzing and displaying data.  Much of the
information appeared in the popular U.S. News & World Report
special issue comparing colleges.


PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
The purpose of the Data Analysis Exposition is to provide a
common dataset for individuals and groups to use to demonstrate
approaches to analyzing data and displaying statistical results.
In keeping with the spirit of this Exposition, one might ask
students prepare posters displaying the results of their own
analyses.  The dataset contains a wealth of information which is
quite naturally of considerable interest to college students.
For example, how does a particular school fair in the data?  Is
your tuition in line with what the other characteristics of your
school suggest it should be?
